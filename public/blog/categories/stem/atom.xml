    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>March 28-31st, 2013 (Memories from the past)</p>

<p>Spring brought with it the local literary convention, NorWesCon.  There were several panels that got me giving a great deal of thought about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>women in STEM (science, technology, engineering, math),</li>
  <li>the importance of networking within my industry,</li>
  <li>and how to re-find my passion in technology</li>
</ul>


<p>I decided it was time to pick back up my long abandoned pursuit of programming and to start networking with other women in technology for mutual support and growth.</p>

<p>Most of my social connections previously have been with men, so networking with women was a frightening notion for me.  I have long shied away from Ladies Nights Out as being very foreign and uncomfortable and not very applicable to who I was.  But, I needed to get out more and freshen my networking skills as a preparation for interviewing so I time to plunge forward right outside my comfort zone.</p>
