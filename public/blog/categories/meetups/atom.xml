<p>The Seattle Rails educational and networking meet-up was an evening-long event with two technical talks, dinner, and networking.  I was pretty nervous going into this, since my programming skills are rusty at best, and I am completely new to Ruby.</p>

<p>The Seattle Rails community was very welcoming.  I felt encouraged and came away eager to continue forward learning Ruby and Rails as well as networking with folks in that community.  &ldquo;Matz Is Nice And So We Are Nice.&rdquo;, sometimes pronounced aloud: MINASWAN.  This is a phrase I learned at this event referring to the ruby language designer,  Mr. Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz).  It seems very true.  I am looking forward to becoming a part of this community.</p>

<p>This was the first in my networking event line up.  A meet-up for the purpose of networking with other geeky women.  It seemed like a good first step to get me started on networking.  I was very nervous going into this, since this sort of thing is <b>way</b> outside of my comfort zone.  Ok, deep breath, I can do this.</p>

<p>It turned out that these were good and friendly folk.  We were all mostly new to this whole networking thing, but that helped somewhat.  I introduced myself to a number of folks and worked on those introduction sorts of conversations.  Some were more successful that others.  I&rsquo;m glad I went.  This was a good training event in how to network.</p>

<p>Spring brought with it the local literary convention, NorWesCon.  There were several panels that got me giving a great deal of thought about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>women in STEM (science, technology, engineering, math),</li>
  <li>the importance of networking within my industry,</li>
  <li>and how to re-find my passion in technology</li>
</ul>


<p>I decided it was time to pick back up my long abandoned pursuit of programming and to start networking with other women in technology for mutual support and growth.</p>

<p>Most of my social connections previously have been with men, so networking with women was a frightening notion for me.  I have long shied away from Ladies Nights Out as being very foreign and uncomfortable and not very applicable to who I was.  But, I needed to get out more and freshen my networking skills as a preparation for interviewing so I time to plunge forward right outside my comfort zone.</p>
