    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>April 11th, 2013 (Memories from the past)</p>

<p>This was the first in my networking event line up.  A meet-up for the purpose of networking with other geeky women.  It seemed like a good first step to get me started on networking.  I was very nervous going into this, since this sort of thing is <b>way</b> outside of my comfort zone.  Ok, deep breath, I can do this.</p>

<p>It turned out that these were good and friendly folk.  We were all mostly new to this whole networking thing, but that helped somewhat.  I introduced myself to a number of folks and worked on those introduction sorts of conversations.  Some were more successful that others.  I&rsquo;m glad I went.  This was a good training event in how to network.</p>
