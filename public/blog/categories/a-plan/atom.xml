    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>April and May 2013 (Memories from the past)</p>

<p>I remembered a nudge towards Ruby Koans that I&rsquo;d been given by a friend and colleague a couple years back and so worked my way through the koans again.  A very good reminder of the fun I had exploring this new language and how easy thing were to implement in Ruby.  Ruby saves developers the extreme pain of memory allocation and pointers and string manipulation.  This made Ruby seem like something to investigate further, so I did a bit of research investigating online learning resources to further my knowledge of Ruby.</p>

<p>I found CodeAcademy and spent most of April and May working my way through their Ruby, JavaScript, and jQuery offerings.  Their lessons are pretty basic, but are a fun introduction and free.  I hadn&rsquo;t really meant to do the JS and jQuery lessons, but their Ruby lessons were broken for a while.  I enjoyed the gamification of the coding lessons, where I could earn a personal high score in Points Today, Day Streak, Total Points, and Badges Completed.</p>

<p>I was rapidly starting to believe that Ruby on Rails may well be a good and enjoyable start along my path towards my goal.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>March 28-31st, 2013 (Memories from the past)</p>

<p>Spring brought with it the local literary convention, NorWesCon.  There were several panels that got me giving a great deal of thought about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>women in STEM (science, technology, engineering, math),</li>
  <li>the importance of networking within my industry,</li>
  <li>and how to re-find my passion in technology</li>
</ul>


<p>I decided it was time to pick back up my long abandoned pursuit of programming and to start networking with other women in technology for mutual support and growth.</p>

<p>Most of my social connections previously have been with men, so networking with women was a frightening notion for me.  I have long shied away from Ladies Nights Out as being very foreign and uncomfortable and not very applicable to who I was.  But, I needed to get out more and freshen my networking skills as a preparation for interviewing so I time to plunge forward right outside my comfort zone.</p>
