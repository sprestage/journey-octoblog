    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>An old friend from my long ago Santa Cruz days visited over Thanksgiving, 2012.  I was pretty uncomfortable in my own skin at the time and had been been feeling like I didn&rsquo;t have anyone I felt like I could turn to.</p>

<p>Turning to others can be very hard.</p>

<p>You see, I&rsquo;m a rather strong personality.  Small surprise there, I know.  But what this ends up meaning is that for all I seem very strong and capable on the outside, I have a lot of doubt and weakness on the inside.  I feel like many people look up to me (I still am perplexed by this), but none of them feel (to me) like they are strong enough and have the perpective to be someone I can lean on and turn to when I&rsquo;m feeling week and in need of someone who sees me as just a person.  Sees me with my faults and foibles, but loves me deeply and so can give me that support that only a friend who has known you for many years can give you.  The kind of support that sometimes involves a boot in the arse.  Thank you, dear Kallie.</p>

<p>She helped me remember the things I find important.  And that my weakness is part of my strength and definitely part of my appeal.  She showed me the beginnings of the support that women can give one another.  And I started to discover some of the strength found from the support of other engineering women.  She reminded me, through many delightfully geeky conversations about my love for engineering, right down to the 1&rsquo;s and 0&rsquo;s of circuit design.  To be sure I&rsquo;d learned my lesson, this valued friend sent me a LED clock engineering kit (AdaFruit is awesome!) for my birthday in the beginning of 2013.  It wasn&rsquo;t very long before I took the time to start soldering the pieces of that clock.  So. Much. Fun.</p>

<p>Hey.  There it is.  My joy in engineering.  Still there, without a doubt.</p>

<p>OK, so now what&hellip;?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello old friends.  Hello new friends.  Hello colleagues.  Hello young learners.  Hello respected professionals.  I am the GeekyMamaMare.  Welcome to my blog.</p>

<p>Please enjoy sharing my journey re-discovering my passion in technology and changing my career from software testing to software development.  A wordy intro statement indeed, but very relevant to my journey as you will see in time.  Let&rsquo;s start by looking at the dilemma I found myself in.</p>

<p>I had been a quality engineer in the computer industry for 20 years, when, in the summer of 2011, my dream job fell through my hands.  I was devastated.  I quickly realized that I was far too emotionally fragile for the moment and needed to take some time away from the industry to recover from my heart ache.  Tears and interviews do not mix.</p>

<p>A year passed and I refreshed my resume and leapt back into the job search.  I have been fortunate in the past in that each job came along just as it was needed, usually through networking, and generally right along the lines of where I wanted my career to go.  This time though, it was a different experience.  None of the jobs available seemed to be a good fit for my skills or my experience.  I also was beginning to discover a lack of motivation in my search.  It was as if my passion for technology and computers was missing.</p>

<p>Time to step back and take the time to figure out my priorities and what made me eager to go to work in the morning, since I sure wasn&rsquo;t seeing anything available in the job market that made me eager to leave my family, my son, my ranch, and my horses every morning.</p>

<p>My new goal started to become clear.</p>

<p>I wanted to renew my passion for technology such that I could find a company to contribute to that made me as eager to head to the office in the morning as I was to return to my beloved ranch in the evening.</p>

<p>Ok, good goal.  Now to develop a plan to take me towards that goal.</p>
