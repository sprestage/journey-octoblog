    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>April and May 2013</p>

<p>I remembered a nudge towards Ruby Koans that I&rsquo;d been given by a friend and colleague a couple years back and so worked my way through the koans again.  A very good reminder of the fun I had exploring this new language and how easy thing were to implement in Ruby.  Ruby saves developers the extreme pain of memory allocation and pointers and string manipulation.  This made Ruby seem like something to investigate further, so I did a bit of research investigating online learning resources to further my knowledge of Ruby.</p>

<p>I found CodeAcademy and spent most of April and May working my way through their Ruby, JavaScript, and jQuery offerings.  Their lessons are pretty basic, but are a fun introduction and free.  I hadn&rsquo;t really meant to do the JS and jQuery lessons, but their Ruby lessons were broken for a while.  I enjoyed the gamification of the coding lessons, where I could earn a personal high score in Points Today, Day Streak, Total Points, and Badges Completed.</p>

<p>I was rapidly starting to believe that Ruby on Rails may well be a good and enjoyable start along my path towards my goal.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>March 28-31st, 2013</p>

<p>Spring brought with it the local literary convention, NorWesCon.  There were several panels that got me giving a great deal of thought about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>women in STEM (science, technology, engineering, math),</li>
  <li>the importance of networking within my industry,</li>
  <li>and how to re-find my passion in technology</li>
</ul>


<p>I decided it was time to pick back up my long abandoned pursuit of programming and to start networking with other women in technology for mutual support and growth.</p>

<p>Most of my social connections previously have been with men, so networking with women was a frightening notion for me.  I have long shied away from Ladies Nights Out as being very foreign and uncomfortable and not very applicable to who I was.  But, I needed to get out more and freshen my networking skills as a preparation for interviewing so I time to plunge forward right outside my comfort zone.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>First, some history to know where I come from, technologically.</p>

<h3>Programming</h3>

<p>I discovered my passion for computers in a programming class I took in high school.  My gradual route through post-high school education eventally took me to the University of California at Santa Cruz.  I had initally planned to major in Computer Science, but when I discovered that they had a Computer Engineering progam where I could learn all about hardware and still take programming classes as my upper division electives, I knew I&rsquo;d found the right program for me.  Years of hard work later saw me successfully earn my degree and employed in the computer industry as a software tester.</p>

<h3>Whoops, a job in test!</h3>

<p>I had initially planned to become a developer, but landed my first industry job at a startup that needed a tester immediately and I was the only one on their list willing to come in the very next day, a Saturday.  Yes, I had social plans, but the opportunity was not to be missed, considering the huge hiring freeze in Silicon Valley at the time.</p>

<h3>Quality Engineering</h3>

<p>Several industry quality engineering positions later, I decided that I very much liked testing, as long as I was working very much inside the development process.  I wanted to be in on the design decisions and debug the specs (specifications) <b>before</b> they were implemented and it was too late.</p>

<p>Slowly the industry changed, turning quality engineers into SDETs and requiring automation of monolithic systems where it&rsquo;s hard to feel like your testing, your coding, or your opinions matter much.  I had managed to avoid this side of the industry.  But now, it seemed to be the standard.  Another failed SDET interview in February seemed to confirm this.</p>
