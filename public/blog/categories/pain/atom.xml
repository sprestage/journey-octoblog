    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello old friends.  Hello new friends.  Hello colleagues.  Hello young learners.  Hello respected professionals.  I am the GeekyMamaMare.  Welcome to my blog.</p>

<p>Please enjoy sharing my journey re-discovering my passion in technology and changing my career from software testing to software development.  A wordy intro statement indeed, but very relevant to my journey as you will see in time.  Let&rsquo;s start by looking at the dilemna I found myself in.</p>

<p>I had been a quality engineer in the computer industry for 20 years, when, in the summer of 2011, my dream job fell through my hands.  I was devastated.  I quickly realized that I was far too emotionally fragile for the moment and needed to take some time away from the industry to recover from my heart ache.  Tears and interviews do not mix.</p>

<p>A year passed and I refreshed my resume and leapt back into the job search.  I have been fortunate in the past in that each job came along just as it was needed, usually through networking, and generally right along the lines of where I wanted my career to go.  This time though, it was a different experience.  None of the jobs available seemed to be a good fit for my skills or my experience.  I also was beginning to discover a lack of motivation in my search.  It was as if my passion for technology and computers was missing.</p>

<p>Time to step back and take the time to figure out my priorities and what made me eager to go to work in the morning, since I sure wasn&rsquo;t seeing anything available in the job market that made me eager to leave my family, my son, my ranch, and my horses every morning.</p>

<p>My new goal started to become clear.</p>

<p>I wanted to renew my passion for technology such that I could find a company to contribute to that made me as eager to head to the office in the morning as I was to return to my beloved ranch in the evening.</p>

<p>Ok, good goal.  Now to develop a plan to take me towards that goal.</p>
