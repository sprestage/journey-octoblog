The Seattle Rails educational and networking meet-up was an evening-long event with two technical talks, dinner, and networking.  I was pretty nervous going into this, since my programming skills are rusty at best, and I am completely new to Ruby.

The Seattle Rails community was very welcoming.  I felt encouraged and came away eager to continue forward learning Ruby and Rails as well as networking with folks in that community.  "Matz is nice, so we are nice.", sometimes pronounced aloud: MINSWAN.  This is a phrase I learned at this event referring to the ruby language designer,  Mr. Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz).  It seems very true.  I am looking forward to becoming a part of this community.
