Winter, 2012/2013 (A turning point)

An old friend from my long ago Santa Cruz days visited over Thanksgiving, 2012.  I was pretty uncomfortable in my own skin at the time and had been been feeling like I didn't have anyone I felt like I could turn to.

Turning to others can be very hard.

You see, I'm a rather strong personality.  Small surprise there, I know.  But what this ends up meaning is that for all I seem very strong and capable on the outside, I have a lot of doubt and weakness on the inside.  I feel like many people look up to me (I still am perplexed by this), but none of them feel (to me) like they are strong enough and have the perspective to be someone I can lean on and turn to when I'm feeling week and in need of someone who sees me as just a person.  Sees me with my faults and foibles, but loves me deeply and so can give me that support that only a friend who has known you for many years can give you.  The kind of support that sometimes involves a boot in the arse.  Thank you, dear Kallie.

She helped me remember the things I find important.  And that my weakness is part of my strength and definitely part of my appeal.  She showed me the beginnings of the support that women can give one another.  And I started to discover some of the strength found from the support of other engineering women.  She reminded me, through many delightfully geeky conversations about my love for engineering, right down to the 1's and 0's of circuit design.  To be sure I'd learned my lesson, this valued friend sent me a LED clock engineering kit (AdaFruit is awesome!) for my birthday in the beginning of 2013.  It wasn't very long before I took the time to start soldering the pieces of that clock.  So. Much. Fun.

Hey.  There it is.  My joy in engineering.  Still there, without a doubt.

OK, so now what...?
