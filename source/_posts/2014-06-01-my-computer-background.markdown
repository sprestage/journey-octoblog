First, some history to know where I come from, technologically.

### Programming
I discovered my passion for computers in a programming class I took in high school.  My gradual route through post-high school education eventually took me to the University of California at Santa Cruz.  I had initially planned to major in Computer Science, but when I discovered that they had a Computer Engineering program where I could learn all about hardware and still take programming classes as my upper division electives, I knew I'd found the right program for me.  Years of hard work later saw me successfully earn my degree and employed in the computer industry as a software tester.

### Whoops, a job in test!
I had initially planned to become a developer, but landed my first industry job at a startup that needed a tester immediately and I was the only one on their list willing to come in the very next day, a Saturday.  Yes, I had social plans, but the opportunity was not to be missed, considering the huge hiring freeze in Silicon Valley at the time.

### Quality Engineering
Several industry quality engineering positions later, I decided that I very much liked testing, as long as I was working very much inside the development process.  I wanted to be in on the design decisions and debug the specs (specifications) <b>before</b> they were implemented and it was too late.

Slowly the industry changed, turning quality engineers into SDETs and requiring automation of monolithic systems where it's hard to feel like your testing, your coding, or your opinions matter much.  I had managed to avoid this side of the industry.  But now, it seemed to be the standard.  Another failed SDET interview in February seemed to confirm this.
