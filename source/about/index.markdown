<CENTER><h2>Welcome to my journey<h2></CENTER>

I am on a journey to re-find and <b>keep</b> my passion in technology and in my career. I spent 20 years testing software in the computer industry, but after losing a dream job, I discovered I’d lost my love and inspiration in technology. I felt lost and frightened and confused. I have long identified myself as an engineer and have an eager love of things geeky. How could I have lost my way?

Thus began a time of self discovery and learning. Along the way I have learned to network with and support other women, especially those in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math). I’m still learning to grow past my anxiety in networking and public speaking. There has been and will be a great deal of hard work and time needed to effectively learn and apply my new skills. But I have just come back from one of the scariest times of my life with purpose and excitement; this helps give me hope, strength, and the courage I will need.

I would like to share with you the stories of what brought me to taking this journey. I want to share the steps I’m taking along my way down this path of change. It can be scary to alter the course of one’s life so directly. I hope to show that it can be done and that I am not an imposter for wanting to make these changes in my life. I am scared, but tentatively finding a great deal of power in what I am doing and I want to share that so others can believe in their own power for change.

I went into this journey sure of 3 things. My perpetual delight in my horses and my ranch. My love for my son and my family. And my continued passion for technology, even though I wasn’t seeing it in my career. These things all contribute to all that I do, so these will also be colorful features here in my blog. Enjoy your time here.

####A few publishing details

It is much easier to see the path of one's journey from the perspective of hindsight.  So this blog will largely be set in the past as it slowly catches up to where I am now on my journey.  I work on the notes for the blog entries as the events are happening in order to capture the raw emotions and experience of the moment.

I plan to publish a new post weekly.  Dates will be put into the posts when relevant to help keep track of the progression of time.
